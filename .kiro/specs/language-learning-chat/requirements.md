# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a language learning application that provides an interactive chat interface for students to practice grammar and vocabulary from their school curriculum. The app will engage users in conversational learning experiences while reinforcing academic language concepts through natural dialogue.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to chat with an AI tutor about topics using my school vocabulary, so that I can practice language skills in a conversational context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a chat session THEN the system SHALL present vocabulary words from their current school level
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL respond using appropriate grammar structures for their level
3. WHEN a user makes a grammar mistake THEN the system SHALL provide gentle corrections within the conversation flow
4. WHEN a user uses vocabulary correctly THEN the system SHALL acknowledge and reinforce the usage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want the app to adapt to my school grade level and curriculum, so that the content matches what I'm learning in class.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets up their profile THEN the system SHALL allow selection of grade level and curriculum type
2. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL use vocabulary and grammar appropriate to the selected level
3. WHEN a user progresses THEN the system SHALL allow updating their grade level settings
4. IF a user struggles with current level content THEN the system SHALL offer to adjust difficulty

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to practice specific grammar topics through conversation, so that I can master concepts I'm studying in school.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a grammar topic THEN the system SHALL create conversation scenarios that naturally use that grammar
2. WHEN practicing grammar THEN the system SHALL provide examples and explanations when requested
3. WHEN a user completes a grammar practice session THEN the system SHALL provide feedback on their usage
4. WHEN grammar errors occur THEN the system SHALL explain the correct form and provide practice opportunities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to track my vocabulary and grammar progress, so that I can see how I'm improving over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes chat sessions THEN the system SHALL record vocabulary words used correctly
2. WHEN grammar concepts are practiced THEN the system SHALL track accuracy and improvement
3. WHEN a user views their progress THEN the system SHALL display statistics on vocabulary mastery and grammar skills
4. WHEN milestones are reached THEN the system SHALL provide encouraging feedback and achievements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a teacher or parent, I want to see what language concepts the student is practicing, so that I can support their learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student uses the app THEN the system SHALL generate progress reports for authorized adults
2. WHEN viewing reports THEN the system SHALL show vocabulary words practiced and grammar topics covered
3. WHEN concerns arise THEN the system SHALL highlight areas where the student needs additional support
4. IF requested THEN the system SHALL provide suggestions for offline practice activities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student, I want to quickly set up learning content by taking a photo of my textbook page, so that I can start practicing immediately without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user takes a photo of a textbook page THEN the system SHALL extract vocabulary words and grammar concepts using OCR
2. WHEN content is extracted THEN the system SHALL allow the user to review and edit the detected items before starting
3. WHEN photo processing is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically create a practice session with the extracted content
4. IF the photo quality is poor THEN the system SHALL request a clearer image or allow manual entry as fallback
5. WHEN content is imported THEN the system SHALL save it for future practice sessions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a student, I want to join classes and groups to access shared learning content, so that I can collaborate with classmates and use content created by others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student joins a class THEN the system SHALL provide access to all learning sets shared within that class
2. WHEN a teacher creates a class THEN the system SHALL allow them to share learning sets with all class members
3. WHEN students are in the same group THEN the system SHALL allow them to collaborate on creating and editing learning sets
4. WHEN a learning set is shared THEN the system SHALL track who has access and allow permission management
5. WHEN browsing shared content THEN the system SHALL show which sets are from classmates, teachers, or public sources

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a student, I want to organize my learning content into collections and individual sets, so that I can study specific topics for tests or practice broader grammar concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating learning content THEN the system SHALL allow organizing into both collections (broad topics) and sets (specific lessons)
2. WHEN studying for a test THEN the system SHALL allow selecting specific sets with focused vocabulary and grammar
3. WHEN doing general practice THEN the system SHALL allow selecting entire collections for broader topic coverage
4. WHEN managing content THEN the system SHALL allow moving sets between collections and creating new organizational structures
5. WHEN sharing content THEN the system SHALL allow sharing individual sets or entire collections with different permission levels

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a student, I want engaging conversation topics that interest me, so that learning feels fun rather than like homework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting conversations THEN the system SHALL offer age-appropriate topics of interest
2. WHEN chatting THEN the system SHALL maintain engaging dialogue while incorporating learning objectives
3. WHEN a user shows interest in specific topics THEN the system SHALL remember and incorporate those preferences
4. WHEN conversations become repetitive THEN the system SHALL introduce new scenarios and contexts
